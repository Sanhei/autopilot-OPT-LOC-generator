!TPSS def2-SVP TightSCF RIJCOSX autoaux TightOPT D3BJ ABC
# TPSS: meta-GGA functional
# def2-SVP: Valence double-zeta basis set with “new” polarization functions
# Grid4: DFT integration grid / Grid4 or larger is recommended for IR
# TightSCF: more strict SCF convergence criteria -> more exact single point energy
# RIJCOX: approximation to speed up the calculation of the exchange term: Mehr-Zentren Integrale werden als Integrale über weniger Zentren approximiert
# autoaux: Automatically provide an auxiliary basis set / Can be used for Coulomb, exchange and correlation fitting and is as accurate as the optimized auxiliary basis sets at the cost of being up to twice as large.
# TightOPT: tight optimization criteria for geometry opt. -> more accurate geometry
# D3BJ: Atom-pairwise dispersion correction to the DFT energy with Becke-Johnson damping: used to avoid near singularities for small distances r(AB)
# ABC: three-body dispersion correction for three atoms A,B,C
# D3BJ ABC: invokes Becke-Johnson damping for E(2) and zero damping for E(3)
