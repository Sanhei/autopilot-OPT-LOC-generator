! B3LYP ZORA-def2-TZVP RIJCOSX TightSCF ZORA D3BJ ABC
# B3LYP: The popular B3LYP functional (20% HF exchange)
# ZORA-def2-TZVP: adapted version of def-TZVP basis set
# RIJCOX: approximation to speed up the calculation of the exchange term: Mehr-Zentren Integrale werden als Integrale Ã¼ber weniger Zentren approximiert
# TightSCF: more strict SCF convergence criteria -> more exact single point energy
# Grid5: DFT Integration Grid. Higher accuracy at higher cost is offered by the higher grids.
# ZORA: Selects the scalar relativistic ZORA Hamiltonian. The ZORA equation is the zeroth order regular approximation to the Dirac equation.
# GRIDX6: Grid for the COSX approximation of the RIJCOSX approximation
# D3BJ: Atom-pairwise dispersion correction to the DFT energy with Becke-Johnson damping: used to avoid near singularities for small distances r(AB)
# ABC: three-body dispersion correction for three atoms A,B,C
# D3BJ ABC: invokes Becke-Johnson damping for E(2) and zero damping for E(3)

# Warning! The localized orbitals have no well defined orbital energy.

# The orbitals for the LR-TDDFT calculation are
# obtained by performing a single-point calculation with the
# BH0.57LYP functional[35] on the pre-optimised model structures.
# This hybrid functional with a high portion of Hartree exchange
# has been shown to give a very good onset energy for carbon
# K-edge XA spectra.[35]
